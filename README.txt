Nayaab Collection — One-page website (Purple & Gold theme)
---------------------------------------------------------

This package is ready to deploy on GitHub Pages. To deploy:

1. Create a new public repository (e.g. NayaabCollection) on GitHub.
2. Upload the contents of this ZIP to the repository (root level).
3. In the repository settings -> Pages, set the source to the main branch (root).
4. To use the custom domain, add the domain 'www.nayaabcollection.com' in the Pages custom domain settings.
   GitHub will create the DNS instructions — you'll need to point your domain's DNS A records to GitHub Pages IPs and add a CNAME for 'www'.

Files:
- index.html
- assets/logo.jpeg (embedded logo you uploaded)
